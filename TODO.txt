ESSENTIAL GOALS
- fix save fleet state once and for all, and make the transfer of ready files easier
- implement different kinds of mapmodes for the map printer (fleets present, fuel present, resource satisfaction, etc)
- autogenerate 'info packages' for each team at the conclusion of each turn (fleets, resources, war progress, etc)
- print out what info teams should know when a battle starts, taking into account intel and counter-intel

STRETCH GOALS
- allow teams to toggle increased production at a location in exchange for war progress loss multiplier?
- higher fuel cost for moving up the gravity well as opposed to deeper in?
- option to aerobrake or not, traversing belt or aerobraking causes damage to the fleet?
- anti-deathball logistics of some sort?
