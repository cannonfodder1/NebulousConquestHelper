- implement fleet merging and split offs with the program generating new .fleet files
- probably swap the whole thing over to a GM-run local program rather than a discord bot
- implement different kinds of mapmodes for the map printer (fleets present, fuel present, resource satisfaction, etc)
- autogenerate 'info packages' for each team at the conclusion of each turn (fleets, resources, war progress, etc)
- allow teams to toggle increased production at a location in exchange for war progress loss multiplier
